        Give all of these classes some properties and methods as you see fit.

        Make the subclasses implement the Mover interface. The move method should print something to the screen to
        indicate that the thing is moving, providing whatever level of detail feels appropriate.
        Make a RadarSpeedGun class. The class should have as a property a list of moving things.
        Give RadarSpeedGun a method that sets all its moving things in motion, and calculates a total speed of all the
        moving things.
                Try utilizing the RadarSpeedGun class with a handful of moving things.
        BONUS: Consider how and why it was advantageous to utilize an interface in this example.
                Could there be an alternative way? What if instead of an interface, we made a Mover class, and made it
                the superclass of all classes (ie, in the example stated above, both Animal and Vehicle would extend Mover)?
